XmlSchemaSQLClassGenerator
=======================

Based on the repository by [mganss/XmlSchemaClassGenerator](https://github.com/mganss/XmlSchemaClassGenerator), this is a VS.Net solution that allows a SQL project to be populated by SQL classes, as opposed to C# POCO. It leverages all the existing qualities from the host repository.
